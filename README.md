# ANTI-Creamer
A discord bot I made while I was frustrated because there were no compliment API's
### The story
I feel like I should put this here just becuase it's kinda funny... Idk<br>
Basically, what happened was that i wanted to make a discord bot that complimented you, hence creamer<br>
However, there were no compliment api's, so after a while of thinkering and doing other bullshittery, i made this masterpiece
### How it works
This bot uses the Evil insult API (https://evilinsult.com/generate_insult.php?lang=en)<br>
So yeah thats cool
### Running
Basically, just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (you might wanna make a venv first tho so run `python -m venv ./venv`; if ur using vscode its easier ig idk tho i use nvim most of the time) then make a config.json with the following content:
```json
{
    "bot_token": "YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE"
}
```
so yeah thats basically it just run python main.py to run the shitty bot i made
